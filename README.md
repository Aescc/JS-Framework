# JSJ Framework
Some simple things to help out in JavaScript.
- Documentation can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/RadAesc/JSJ-Framework/wiki), video tutorials coming soon!
- The framework is targeted towards game development.  Although I have used it to make software and it is possible, that is not the optimal use of JSJ.
- This is the crown jewel of my profile, I really hope it is helpful to somebody.
